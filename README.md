## Functions in C++ (OOP Practice)

This folder contains small C++ programs focused on understanding:

Objects as arguments

Returning objects from functions

Class design fundamentals

Basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts

These programs are part of my C++ learning journey while strengthening OOP fundamentals.
